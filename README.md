# LUDO-GAME

Progressive Ludo Game Project
Welcome to the Progressive Ludo Game repository! This project is developed as part of our computer science coursework and aims to implement a Ludo game in Python with increasing levels of complexity from one piece per player to the standard four pieces per player.

## Game Description
The game consists of a single version that starts with two players, each with one piece, and can be expanded to four pieces each. It incorporates basic Ludo rules with some adaptations to fit the course requirements and simplify the gameplay.

## Features
Single and Multiple Pieces: Start with one piece per player and advance to four pieces.
Turn-based Play: Players take turns rolling a die to move their pieces.
No Kicking Out: No pieces are kicked out in this version to simplify the game logic.
Winning Condition: The game ends when a player gets all their pieces (either one or four) home.

## How to Play
Starting the Game: Players need to roll a six to move their pieces from the start.
Moving Pieces: Enter the number rolled to move the piece forward.
Game Progression: The game progresses from managing one piece per player to managing multiple pieces.
End Game: The first player to get all pieces home wins the game.
