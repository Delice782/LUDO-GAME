# LUDO-GAME

This repository features the Progressive Ludo Game, a simplified and educational variant of the traditional board game designed to teach game development fundamentals. Starting with basic gameplay for two players each controlling one piece, the game evolves to include up to four pieces per player, demonstrating increased complexity and strategic depth. This project is implemented in Python and serves as a practical introduction to programming concepts such as turn-based mechanics, user interaction, and state management. Ideal for students and beginners looking to understand the basics of game development and software engineering.
